# Quantifying alarm fatigue caused by fault and defect detection systems

This project provides the code and data needed to reproduce the paper. 

## Structure of the project
- `afm/` : Contains the main scripts :
  - `pca.py` : Implements the class `PCA_Fault_Detection`.
  - `utils.py` : utility functions.
- `data/` : Data for the academic case study.They are taken from [1]. For the faulty_testing set, only one simulation run is considered as explained in the paper.
- `examples/` : Notebook for reproducing the academic case study.

## Instructions
